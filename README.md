<h3>Day 1 (ARRAYS)</h3>
1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-binary-array-using-one-traversal/<br>
Given a binary array, sort it using one traversal and no extra space.<br>
2. https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/<br>
Given n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each represents a point at coordinate (i, a_i) . 
‘ n ‘ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, a_i) and (i, 0).
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.<br>
3. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/equilibrium-index-of-an-array/<br>
Equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.<br> 
4. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-duplicates-in-on-time-and-constant-extra-space/<br>
Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. 
Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.<br>
5. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-frequencies-elements-array-o1-extra-space-time/<br>
Given an unsorted array of n integers which can contain integers from 1 to n. 
Some elements can be repeated multiple times and some other elements can be absent from the array. 
Count frequency of all elements that are present and print the missing elements.<br>
6. https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/<br>
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
Each element in the result must be unique.
The result can be in any order.<br>
7. https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/<br>
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.<br>
8. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-second-largest-element-array/<br>
Given an array of integers, our task is to write a program that efficiently finds the second largest element present in the array. <br>
9. https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-circular-subarray/<br>
Given n numbers (both +ve and -ve), arranged in a circle, fnd the maximum sum of consecutive number. <br>
10. https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/max-sum-in-the-configuration/1<br>
Given an array(0-based indexing), you have to find the max sum of i*A[i] where A[i] is the element at index i in the array. The only operation allowed is to rotate(clock-wise or counter clock-wise) the array any number of times.
